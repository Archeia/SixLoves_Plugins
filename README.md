# SixLoves_Plugins

A set of RPG Maker MV plugins for a fangame I'm writing.

Go to fantranslation.org/sixloves for more information.

## Usage

Overlay the contents of js/plugins into your RPG Maker MV project's existing
js/plugins directory. Activate specific plugins from the Plugins screen of RPG
Maker. Make sure to read their documentation to learn what their dependencies
are (if any) and what order they should be loaded in.

CAUTION: On OSX, clicking and dragging a directory into a place with another
directory of the same name will overwrite everything in that existing directory
instead of merging it.

## License

Permission is granted to use these plugins in all RPG Maker projects, both
commercial and non-commercial.

As RPG Maker is not a Free Software licensed program we cannot provide proper
Free Software licensing so long as these plugins constitute a derivative work
of the game engine. It may be possible to extract some useful code from these
plugins for use in non-RPG-Maker Pixi.js projects; if you are looking to use
such code outside of RPG Maker, please inquire as I may be able to produce an
MIT-licensed Pixi-only version of that code.
